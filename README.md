# Coloring

All the images are located at X:\...\FreeLanceWork\Assets\Sprites

You'd have to open each image in an editor if your choice, make modifications and simply save using the ***SAME FILE NAME, EXTENSION and DIRECTORY***

Once all necessary modifications are made, just open Unity and the project should just work without any modifications needed.

# Code

All the code for this project is located at X:\...\FreeLanceWork\Assets\Scripts

There are three scripts
```
	1. BillboardController.cs
	2. CameraFollow.cs
	3. SwingController.cs 
```

BillboardController rotates the sprite (Character) to always face the camera.

CameraFollow is sused to follow the ball.

SwingController is the game's core mechanic and controls the animation, force applied to the ball for each swing, and the rotation of the arrow. 

ALL THESE SCRIPTS WORK WITHOUT NEEDING THE OTHERS.THEY ARE HIGHLY MODULAR IN THAT SENSE.

The other files included in the project are a free minigolf kit and several space background sets called skyboxes. These skyboxes are paid assets, which should ideally not be used in the final game to avoid copyright infringements. 

If you're not satisfied with the animations, this tutorial is the best way to quickly learn how to use the unity animator.

That's all there is to it, I guess.
